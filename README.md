# viewpoint plurality assessment of historical corpora: The case of the medieval rabbinic literature

 Code and resources for the artilce: Citation network analysis for viewpoint plurality assessment of historical corpora: The case of the medieval rabbinic literature

This project aims to assess viewpoint plurality within a network composed of authors organized by communities.

The assessment is based on the following measurements:
1. **Resource Diversity**: The number of distinct external resources from other communities in the network out of all the distinct cited resources.
2. **External Citationsâ€™ Outdegree**: The number of outgoing citations to resources from other network communities out of all the outgoing citations.

These measurements are applied at both the individual author level and the entire community level.

The project was tested on medieval rabbinic literature, and all resources are from this domain. The network of references was built by scanning the majority of the medieval rabbinic literature. The tool used for scanning the literature is [Heb_references_extractor](https://github.com/NatiBenGigi/Heb_references_extractor), which is also available at the provided link.

## Development and Execution

The project was developed in Python. To execute the code, ensure the following:
1. Install Python and all the required libraries.
2. Maintain the project structure (folders, file names, and locations).

Detailed information about the research can be found in the article: **"Citation Network Analysis for Viewpoint Plurality Assessment of Historical Corpora: The Case of Medieval Rabbinic Literature,"** which will be published later.
